## 📋 **Project Overview**

A **fully automated Multi-Tier Web Application Architecture** deployed on **AWS Cloud**.

This project implements a **scalable, secure, and automated** 3-tier architecture using modern DevOps tools.  
It includes a **VPC** with public and private subnets, **Application Load Balancer**, **EC2 instances** for web and app tiers, and **RDS** for the database tier.  
**Terraform** automates infrastructure provisioning, **Jenkins** handles CI/CD pipelines, and **Docker** ensures consistent deployments.

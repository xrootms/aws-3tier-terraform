## 📋 **Project Overview**

A fully automated deployment of a **multi-tier web application architecture** on **AWS**. The infrastructure consists of a VPC with public and private subnets, Internet Gateway, NAT Gateway, **Application Load Balancer**, **EC2 instances** (for web and app tiers), and **RDS** (for database tier). **Terraform** was used for infrastructure provisioning, **Jenkins** for continuous integration and delivery, and **Docker** for application containerization.

## ⚙️ **Role & Responsibilities**

- Setup and managed a highly available 3-tier architecture on AWS using Terraform modules. 
- Configured Jenkins pipelines for automated build, test, and deployment processes. 
- **Containerized** the web and app layers using **Docker** and deployed them on **EC2 instances**.  
- Used Ansible for configuration management, Set up **Nginx** as a reverse proxy and load balancer. 
- Integrated **AWS CloudWatch** for monitoring and centralized logging.  
- Applied **IAM roles**, **security groups**, and **private subnets** for secure deployments.
- Cost optimization: using Auto Scaling, right-sized and reserved instances, and automated EC2 scheduling to stop/start non-production servers and databases when not in use, while monitoring spend with AWS Cost Explorer.
